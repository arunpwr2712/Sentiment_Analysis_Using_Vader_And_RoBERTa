# Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Vader_And_RoBERTa

**Overview**


This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool and the RoBERTa pre-trained model. Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. This project combines the lexicon-based approach of VADER with the deep learning capabilities of RoBERTa to achieve accurate sentiment classification.


**Features**


**VADER Sentiment Analysis**: VADER is used to quickly analyze sentiment from text using a lexicon and a set of grammatical rules.

**RoBERTa Pre-trained Model**: RoBERTa, a robustly optimized BERT pre-training approach, is employed to capture contextual understanding of text and enhance sentiment analysis.

**Multi-class Sentiment Classification**: The project classifies sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral classes, providing a comprehensive view of emotional content.
